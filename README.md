Description: Apple Pie game to guess the word.
Added all recommended features from "Strech Goal" section:

- used "map" method to convert the array of characters to an array of strings in updateUI().
- added a scoring feature that awards points for each correct guess and additional points for each successful word completion.
- added ability for two players to play, switching turns after each incorrect guess.
- added ability to guess the full word using the keyboard instead of guessing one letter at a time using the interface buttons.
- added support letters with special characters. For example, the E button could check for "e" and "é" within a word.

Technologies Used: Interface Builder, Foundation & UIKIt, Swift, Xcode
